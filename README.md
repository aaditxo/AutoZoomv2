# AutoZoom v2
AutoZoom returns with a new and exciting WhatsApp scraping feature!

# Old
The python script of AutoZoom v1 lets you join a Zoom Meeting by voice using pyautogui, flask, speech_recognition and pyttsx3

# What's New?
AutoZoom v2 is a console based application that requires you to log into WhatsApp Web in the beginning of your day, and until you close the application, it scrapes the messages from selected chats for zoom links, and if any new zoom link is received, you are prompted to join the meeting. And if you click 'join' on the prompt, pyautogui will automatically join the zoom meeting for you!
